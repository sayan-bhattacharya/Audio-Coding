# Audio Coding Seminar Repository

## Overview

This repository contains the problems, codes, and solutions developed as part of the Audio Coding seminars for the Audio Coding course offered by the University. The work was carried out by a group of four students, each contributing to different parts of the overall problem.

## Contents

The repository is organized into several key sections, each focusing on different aspects of advanced Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithms:

1. **Quantization**: Implementation and analysis of various quantization techniques used in audio coding.
2. **Sampling**: Exploration of sampling methods and their impact on audio quality and data compression.
3. **Filter Banks**: Design, implementation, and evaluation of filter banks for efficient audio signal processing.

## Group Contributions

- **Member 1**: Focused on the implementation and optimization of quantization algorithms.
- **Member 2**: Worked on sampling techniques and their practical applications in audio coding.
- **Member 3**: Designed and evaluated filter banks, ensuring efficient signal processing.
- **Member 4**: Integrated the various components and performed comprehensive testing and validation.
